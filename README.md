# IOReg: Individual Organism Registry

## Purpose

__IOReg__ attempts to provide a mechanism to register arbitrary individual organisms of any given species, for the sake
of providing a universal, unique ID (in the form of a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) to that
individual.

The hope is to allow each individual organism to be referenced consistently across multiple applications and datasets.  Yes, this is
a pretty ambitious/crazy goal.
